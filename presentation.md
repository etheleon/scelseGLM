Dispersion and Means
Statistical estimates of the pop, therefore:

1.  sampling error
2.  variable,
3.  inexact

Probabilistic statements rather than absolute conclusions (ref pvalues)


## Tests

### t_test


Among samples


### Linear Models

#### Assumptions
1. Homogeneous variances
2. Normality


### Family Distributions
* negative bionomial (counts but large numbers)
* gamma

### Link functions

Yi = exp ( g(Xi) )


g(Xi) = alpha + beta1(X1) + beta2(X2)
